# svc-demo

A demo repository for experiments in code management.
This repository is used to test a git tool.
This means that most commits are just small forced changes.
But otherwise this is a real working project.

## Installation

```st
Metacello new
	repository: 'github://svenvc/svc-demo:main/src';
	baseline: 'SvcDemo';
	load
```
